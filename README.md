Hello in this stage we will break down the Telecom identifying innefective operators task. 

## Goal 

The overall goal of this task to is to find the innefective telecom operators for my superiors. What inneffective means is that there are many missed calls and a long wait time for incoming and outbound calls. The reason we are looking for this data is to help my surpervisors understand what will allow us to provide a better service for our customers. Based on my analysis we will have a better understanding which operators to continue using and which operators we need to get rid of. 

Boiled down Task: Determine the operators with most missed calls and longest wait times

### Hypothesis 

Null Hypothesis:
Call length changes depending on operators because the service is not as good. 

Alternative Hypothesis:
Call length in unrelated to operator. 


## We will need to look into the relationship between call length and operator

## identify the probabilities of call length and operators

## Compare the type of customers with length of the calls they have 

1. For each customer for the average length of calls 
2. split the customers into n categories 
3. for each category see the most prevelant operators 
4. within each category define extra indicators.
5. Make conclusions on the data 

## Steps and Stages 

In order to complete this assignment we are going to need a good game plan. 

The steps are as follows:

1. Data preprocessing: data gets transformed into usable data 
2. Exploratory data analysis: Looking at the data we have, look for missing values, abnormal values,convert the values, remove duplicates, manage mislabeled columns. 
3. Break down the groups: finding ineffective operators, making clusters, further getting a grip on the data, using groupby to make groups. 
4. Hypothesis testing: using statistical methods to see if they hypothesis makes sense. 
5. (potentially) machine learning: breaking the data into train and test, using the data to create clusters. See what features clusters have to get a better understanding of the data.
